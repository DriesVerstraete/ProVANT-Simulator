# What is this feature?

<!--
    What is exactly the feature you are requesting. Please be as specific as
    possible.

    For example:
    Allow simulation of multiple robots;

    Considering a scenario of an emergency in which the UAVs are employed in
    order to allow better visualization and monitoring of an extensive area,
    it would be interesting to have a simulation in which multiple UAVs 
    cooperate in order to cover all of the designed problem.

    Furthermore, this feature would allow simulation of motion planning 
    techniques considering the detailed dynamical models of the UAVs contained
    in the ProVANT simulator software.
-->

# What is your use case?

<!--
    Describe the use case in which you need this new feature.
    
    For example:
    Run a simulation of a novel motion planning algorithm based on a probability
    map that coordinates multiple UAVs.
-->

# What is the context of your use case?

<!--
    Please provide a little background about the use case described in the 
    previous section.

    For example:
    This feature will be used in an publication submitted to a conference
    or journal paper.

    or

    This feature will be used in a section fo my dissertation or thesis.

# How important is this feature for your use case?

<!--
    Please classify the importance of the requested feature under the following
    list.
-->

- [ ] Desireable
- [ ] Important
- [ ] Critical

# Requirements

<!--
    List the requirements of the feature you are requesting, that are needed
    in order to allow the realization of your use case.

    For example:

    - Allow the simulation of multiple UAVs;
    - Allow the specification of the UAV model, and quantity of models
    spawned in the simulator;
    - Allow monitoring and logging of the distinct UAVs states separately;
    - Allow the recording of the simulation with multiple UAVs;
-->

# Are you able to help in the development of this feature?

<!--
    Please keep in mind that the available manpower to the ProVANT simulator
    project is limited and complex features for external members may not be
    a priority of the project members and students.
-->

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] I'm willing to help, but I have limited experience with ROS and/or Gazebo,
 and would require assistance from a team member
- [ ] No
