name: Change Request
about: Modify an existing feature.

# What are the proposed changes?
<!--
    Describe in a brief paragraph what are the changes you are proposing.

    For example:
    Use the URDF format for the UAVs description.
-->

# What components of the project will be affected?
<!--
    List all of the components and features which would be affected by
    the proposed change.

    For example:
    - UAV2 model
    - UAV2 with load model
    - UAV3 model
    - UAV4 model
    - Quadrotor model
-->

# Motivation
<!--
    Why is the change needed?

    For example:
    The URDF file format is used for many other ROS components, such as Movit
    and Rviz, so the use of URDF would allow better compatibility with ROS and
    to display and interact with the models in any compatible ROS software.
    While the SDF format is so far only used by Gazebo.
-->

# Are you able to help in the development of this change?

<!--
    Please keep in mind that the available manpower to the ProVANT simulator
    project is limited and complex changes for external members may not be
    a priority of the project members and students.

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] I'm willing to help, but I have limited experience with ROS and/or Gazebo,
 and would require assistance from a team member
