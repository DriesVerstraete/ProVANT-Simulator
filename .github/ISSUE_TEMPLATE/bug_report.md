# Issue title

<!--
    Please replace the "Issue title" with a brief description of your problem.
    Such as "The control node process dies during UAV 2 simulation".
-->

## Issue description

<!--
    Please include here a more detailed description about the issue you are
    reporting:

    For example:
    "When trying to run a simulation with the world vant_2.world, the
    simulation never starts, and there is a message informing that the
    controller node has died."
-->

## What is the expected behavior?

<!--
    Please describe how do you believe the system should behaved in the specific
    situation of the issue you are reporting.

    For example:
    "
    After a click in the Start Gazebo button on the ProVANT simulator GUI, the
    gazebo simulation starts together with all the other relevant ROS nodes,
    and the UAV moves on screen according to the selected control strategy
    and desired trajectory or setpoint.
    "
-->

## What is your system configuration, operational system and simulator version?

<!--
    Describe the basic configuration of the computer used when the issue 
    ocurred, including the CPU model, installed RAM, GPU model, operational 
    system and version, and the commit hash of the simulator version you are
    running.

    The commit hash is a string of the following format:
    e2feb855facfaa27e40e9a68edc307a92580fdef

    And this can be found at the very start of the ouput of the git show 
    command.

    An example of these details are:
    Intel Core i7 7500U with 16 GB of RAM, and a NVidia GTX 920MX GPU running
    Ubuntu Linux version 18.04.
    Using the code available under the ProVANT Simulator developer with commit
    hash e2feb855facfaa27e40e9a68edc307a92580fdef.

## What are the steps for reproduction?

<!--
    What are the steps necessary in order to reproduce the issue you are 
    reporting?

    For example:

    - Open the ProVANT Simulator GUI via the command line;
    - Open the empty/vant_2 world;
    - Select the vant2_lqr control strategy;
    - Start the gazebo simulation;
-->

## Auxiliary files

<!--
    If possible, and relevant, please provide all of the resources that can
    help in the determination and reproduction of the issue you are reporting.

    Examples of helpfull files include, but are not limited to:

    - The full output of the process which originated the error from the 
    terminal.
    - A print of the simulation screen highlighting the errors.
    - The output from the process execution window of the GUI, containing the 
    process which generated the issue.

    Please, don't just paste the content directly on the github issue, if 
    possible upload the file to Dropbox, Google Drive or a similar service and
    paste a publicly accessible for the file with a brief description above the
    link.
